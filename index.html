      <h1>About Me</h1>

      <img src="assets/images/picofme2.jpg" class="auth-image" alt="You are missing out on a picture of me">
      <p>My name is Wesley Berry, and I am an aspiring software developer. I grew up in
            Wimberley, Tx and am currently located in San Marcos.
            I spend a healthy yet large majority of my time working on my education at the University of Texas'
            Coding Bootcamp. I am developing and refining my skills
            in web development to adequately prepare myself for a career. I enjoy expressing myself creatively, and
            coding
            is the best means by which to do so.
        </p>
        <p>In my limited free time, you can find me in the gym, meal prepping, or playing music
            with my friends.
            I also enjoy spending time outdoors, whether it be hiking, playing frisbee, or running a Spartan
            Race.
